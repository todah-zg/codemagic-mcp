# codemagic-mcp Roadmap

*Based on capability research across the App Store Connect API, the asc CLI, the
Google Play Developer API, codemagic-cli-tools, and the third-party testing
ecosystem (June 2026).*

The product thesis stays fixed: **Codemagic builds and signs; the agent handles the
reactive store lifecycle.** Every phase below deepens one side of that seam without
crossing it.

---

## Where we are (Phase 5 — in progress)

**Phase 1:** 27 tools across four domains (Codemagic, ASC, Google Play, YAML), 15 yaml
templates, project-type detection, three workflow prompts, webhook management,
29 passing tests. Full loop proven: onboard repo → debug build → release build →
TestFlight / Google Play.

**Phase 2:** Complete publishing loop on both platforms, plus build diagnostics,
release note validation, and full Codemagic API coverage. iOS adds: `upload_build_to_asc`,
`submit_for_app_store_review`, `validate_app_submission`, `set_version_metadata`,
`set_export_compliance`, `release_version`, `set_phased_release`, `submit_beta_review`,
`add_testflight_tester`, `create_testflight_group`. Android adds:
`promote_google_play_release`, `set_rollout_fraction`, `share_app_internally`,
`get_latest_build_number`. Codemagic adds: `list_teams`, `get_build_logs`,
`list_variables`, `update_variable`, `delete_variable`, `list_caches`, `delete_cache`,
`create_public_artifact_url`, `instance_type` on `trigger_build`, `wait_for_build`
redesigned as single-check. Cross-store adds: `prepare_release_notes`. Both
`/ios_release` and `/android_release` prompts updated end-to-end.

**Phase 3:** Store listings, screenshots, and data safety. iOS adds: `get_ios_store_listing`,
`set_ios_store_listing`, `list_ios_screenshot_types`, `upload_ios_screenshots`. Android
adds: `get_android_store_listing`, `set_android_store_listing`, `upload_android_screenshots`,
`set_android_data_safety` via a new `androidpublisher.ts` direct API client (google-play
CLI has no listing, image, or data safety support). New `codemagic.yaml` templates:
`ios-screenshots` (Maestro + iOS simulator), `android-screenshots` (Maestro + Android
emulator on Linux), `flutter-screenshots` (Flutter golden tests, no emulator).
Total: 65 tools, 18 templates.

**Phase 4:** Guidance layer. `first_publish_ios` and `first_publish_android` prompt
checklists walk first-time publishers through the UI-only steps (Apple Developer
enrollment, app record creation, age rating, privacy labels; Play account, IARC rating,
closed testing period) and hand off to the existing release workflows. New
`check_publish_readiness` tool aggregates live API checks (valid build, store listing
completeness, binary validation via `asc validate`) with a static "human required"
section for items that have no public API. Every item is tagged "agent can fix" or
"human required" so the agent knows exactly what to do next. Total: 66 tools, 5 prompts,
18 templates.

What we can NOT do today: reject-and-reply via Resolution Center (UI only on both
stores); deep export compliance status read-back; screenshot presence check (would
require a new `asc screenshots list` wrapper).

---

## Phase 2 — Complete the publishing loop

*The biggest gap: an agent can deliver a build to TestFlight but cannot release
anything to either store. This phase closes the loop end-to-end.*

### iOS (wrapping more of the asc CLI we already require)

The asc CLI turns out to cover nearly the entire ASC API surface (verified
locally via `asc capabilities`). New tools, in priority order:

| Tool | Wraps | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `upload_build_to_asc` + `submit_for_app_store_review` | `asc builds upload` (fast, no wait) + `asc review submit` | Replaces the original `publish_to_app_store` blocking call. Upload returns in 2-5 min; agent polls `list_asc_builds` until VALID; submit is near-instant. |
| `validate_app_submission` | `asc validate` | Preflight readiness report; catches missing metadata/compliance before a doomed submission |
| `set_version_metadata` | `asc apps info edit` / `asc localizations` | "What's New" is mandatory every release; submission is unusable without it |
| `set_export_compliance` | `asc encryption` | A missing declaration silently blocks TestFlight distribution |
| `release_version` / `set_phased_release` | `asc release` / phased-release controls | Start/pause/resume a rollout — exactly the reactive lifecycle agents are good at |
| `add_testflight_tester` / `create_testflight_group` | `asc testflight testers/groups` | Real gap: cli-tools has no tester-by-email management |
| `submit_beta_review` | `asc review submit` (beta) | Required before any external TestFlight distribution |

### Android (google-play CLI + direct androidpublisher calls) (complete)

| Tool | Wraps | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `promote_google_play_release` | `google-play tracks promote-release` | internal → alpha → beta → production without re-uploading; supports staged rollout fraction |
| `set_rollout_fraction` / `halt_rollout` | `google-play tracks set-release` | Expand, pause, or halt a staged rollout — the "something is wrong, stop the release" button |
| `share_app_internally` | `google-play internal-app-sharing upload` | Instant shareable QA link, no track/review ceremony, same credentials we already hold — cheapest high-value add |
| `get_latest_build_number` | `google-play get-latest-build-number` | Replaces the "scan all tracks and find the max" dance in our prompts |

### Cross-store

| Tool | Notes |
|---|---|
| `prepare_release_notes` | ✓ complete — validates BCP-47 locale codes and char limits (Android: 500, iOS: 4000). The LLM writes the notes; the tool validates them before submission. Git commit fetching deferred (requires per-provider auth complexity not worth the trade-off). |

### Diagnostic tools

| Tool | Notes |
|---|---|
| `get_build_logs` | ✓ complete — fetches per-step log text via the v1 API. Returns failed steps by default; optional `step_name` filter for specific steps. Logs truncated at 20k chars (tail). |

**Build page URL:** `trigger_build` should also return the direct Codemagic build URL (`https://codemagic.io/app/{appId}/build/{buildId}`), constructable from data already in hand — no extra API call. The user can open it immediately to watch the build in real time.

**Deliverable:** prompts updated so `/ios_release` ends at the App Store (not
TestFlight) and `/android_release` includes promote + staged rollout guidance.

### Codemagic API completeness

Gaps identified via competitive analysis (June 2026):

| Tool | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `cancel_build` | ✓ complete | If an agent triggers the wrong build, it has no way to stop it. One POST call. |
| `get_user` / `list_teams` | ✓ complete | The agent can't discover which teams the token belongs to — `list_builds` requires a `team_id` that must be known in advance. `list_teams` solves the discovery problem. |
| `get_build_logs` | ✓ complete | Fetch per-step log text via v1 API (`api.codemagic.io/builds/{id}/step/{step_id}`). |
| Instance type on `trigger_build` | ✓ complete | `instance_type` parameter added. Confirmed via v1 API test — `instanceType` in the trigger payload overrides the YAML setting. |
| `update_variable` / `delete_variable` | ✓ complete | CRUD completeness for variable management. |
| `list_caches` / `delete_cache` | ✓ complete | Available via v1 API (`/apps/{id}/caches`). `delete_cache` accepts an optional `cache_id` — omit to delete all. |
| `create_public_artifact_url` | ✓ complete | Available via v1 API (`POST /artifacts/{secureFilename}/public-url`). Accepts an artifact URL from `get_build`/`wait_for_build` and an `expires_in_hours` parameter (default 24). |

### White-label / matrix builds

Inspired by the Codemagic dynamic workflows pattern: one `codemagic.yaml` workflow triggered N times with different variable sets to produce N differently-branded artifacts (bundle ID, app name, branding URLs, signing identity). Common for white-label apps and multi-flavor Android builds.

| Tool | Notes |
|---|---|
| `trigger_build_matrix` | Accepts a base trigger config + a list of variable sets. Fires one build per set in parallel, returns all build IDs immediately. The agent then polls each with `wait_for_build`. |

### Rethinking build status polling

The current `wait_for_build` design has a fundamental impedance mismatch: MCP clients timeout in ~60 seconds, but a Codemagic build machine takes 45–60 seconds just to spin up. With a 30-second polling interval, the tool gets at most one status check before hitting the timeout — and that check almost always returns "still building" because the machine hasn't even started executing yet.

✓ **Resolved.** `wait_for_build` is now a single-check tool — it calls `getBuild` once and returns immediately. Non-terminal status returns "call again with the same build_id"; terminal status returns full details and artifacts. The agent controls retry cadence. The description explicitly tells agents that 20+ calls across a 10–40 minute build is normal.

**Medium term:** MCP streaming responses let a single tool call emit status updates over time — no repeated calls, no client-side timeout. Worth tracking the MCP spec here.

**Phase 5 (hosted) fully solves this:** the hosted server can maintain server-side build-monitoring jobs. `trigger_build` registers a job; `wait_for_build` polls the job's resolved state server-side. The agent gets build completion without holding a connection open for 40 minutes. Codemagic already has this infrastructure.

### Long-running App Store operations

✓ **Resolved.** `publish_to_app_store` (the 40-minute blocking call) has been replaced by two fast tools:
1. **`upload_build_to_asc`** — `asc builds upload` (no `--wait`), returns in ~2-5 minutes once the upload commits.
2. **`submit_for_app_store_review`** — `asc review submit`, attaches the VALID build to the version and submits for review. Near-instant.

Apple's processing time (10–30 min) is now handled by the agent polling `list_asc_builds` between the two calls — the same re-entrant pattern as `wait_for_build`. The `/ios_release` prompt updated to reflect the new 16-step flow.

---

## Phase 3 — Store presence (listings & assets)

*After the loop works, make the store listing itself agent-manageable.*

- ✓ **Store listing text** — iOS via `asc metadata pull/validate/apply`; Android via
  direct `edits.listings` API (google-play CLI has no listing support). New
  `androidpublisher.ts` client handles service account JWT auth, edit lifecycle, and
  PATCH. Tools: `get_ios_store_listing`, `set_ios_store_listing`,
  `get_android_store_listing`, `set_android_store_listing`.
- ✓ **Screenshot upload** — iOS via `asc screenshots upload` (fan-out mode, locale
  subdir); Android via `edits.images` simple upload with `?uploadType=media`. Both
  accept individual artifact URLs from Codemagic builds. Tools:
  `list_ios_screenshot_types`, `upload_ios_screenshots`, `upload_android_screenshots`.
- ✓ **Screenshot capture templates** — three new `codemagic.yaml` templates:
  - `ios-screenshots` — Maestro + iOS simulator on `mac_mini_m2`
  - `android-screenshots` — Maestro + Android emulator on `linux_x2`
  - `flutter-screenshots` — Flutter golden tests at store dimensions (no simulator)
  - Screenshot filenames encode locale and device type (`screenshots/{locale}/{device_type}/`)
    so the agent can route artifact URLs to the correct upload call without guessing.
  - Maestro chosen over fastlane snapshot: YAML-based flows, cross-platform, lower barrier.
- **Caption/frame pipeline** — deferred. `asc screenshots frame` is experimental;
  store policy requires screenshots to reflect the real app. Deferred until the
  experimental commands stabilise.
- ✓ **Data safety form (Android)** — `POST applications/{packageName}/dataSafety` accepts
  the CSV declaration as a string in a JSON body. Operates outside the edit lifecycle
  (direct POST, takes effect immediately). No GET endpoint exists — the CSV is exported
  once from Play Console and re-uploaded when data practices change. Tool:
  `set_android_data_safety`.

---

## Phase 4 — The guidance layer (first-publish reality)

*Research verdict: neither store allows creating the app record via public API.
The first publish cannot be 100% agent-driven — so we make the human part as
small and as guided as possible.*

**The hard, human-only steps:**

| | iOS | Android |
|---|---|---|
| Account setup | Apple Developer Program enrollment, agreements/tax/banking | Play developer account ($25), identity verification |
| App record creation | Web UI only (no `POST /v1/apps`) | Web UI only (no create in androidpublisher v3) |
| Compliance forms | Privacy "nutrition labels" (UI only) | IARC content rating, app-content declarations (UI only) |
| Review friction | Resolution Center replies are UI-only | New personal accounts: mandatory closed-testing period with minimum testers before production access |

**What we built:**

- ✓ `first_publish_ios` prompt — walks through Apple Developer enrollment, app record
  creation, age rating questionnaire, privacy nutrition labels, privacy policy URL,
  and first version creation; then hands off to `/ios_release`.
- ✓ `first_publish_android` prompt — covers Play developer account, identity
  verification, app record creation, IARC content rating, data safety form,
  app access, target audience, and the closed testing requirement for new personal
  accounts; then hands off to `/android_release`.
- ✓ `check_publish_readiness` tool — live API checks: valid build (`listAscBuilds`),
  store listing completeness (`getIosStoreListing` / `getAndroidStoreListing`),
  binary validation (`asc validate` for iOS, bundle + track presence for Android).
  Static "human required" section always present: age rating, privacy labels, legal
  agreements (iOS); IARC, data safety, app access, closed testing (Android). Every
  item tagged "agent can fix" with tool name, or "human required" with Play/ASC
  navigation path.
- Rejection handling: agent can detect rejection via `get_asc_review_status` and
  explain the cited guideline — Resolution Center replies remain UI-only. Deferred
  to a later phase if asc experimental `web review` stabilises.

---

## Phase 5 — Intelligence & engagement layer

*Research verdict (June 2026): the build → ship loop is solid. Phase 5 adds the next
two questions agents naturally ask: "what happened after I shipped?" (analytics, reviews)
and "why did this build fail?" (test results). Plus: engaging with users via review replies
is one of the clearest "agent saves real time" workflows and both stores have clean APIs.*

### Test results

Codemagic renders JUnit XML test results visually in the build UI but does not expose
them via the REST API. However, JUnit XML files appear in the build's artifact list, so
the MCP server can download and parse them directly.

Every mobile platform emits JUnit XML:
- **Flutter**: `flutter test --machine` → Codemagic converts to JUnit XML
- **Android**: `build/app/outputs/androidTest-results/connected/*.xml`
- **iOS**: `codemagic-cli-tools xcode-project junit-test-results` converts `.xcresult`

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `get_test_results` | Takes a `build_id`. Finds JUnit XML in the build's artifact list by heuristic filename matching, downloads and parses it, returns structured pass/fail/duration/error data. |

Flaky test tracking (detecting a test that fails intermittently across builds) is explicitly
out of scope — it requires persistent cross-build storage which a stateless MCP server
cannot provide. An agent can detect a failure in a single build; trend analysis belongs in
Buildkite Test Engine, Trunk, or similar services.

### User review management

Apple's ASC API does **not** have a POST endpoint for posting new developer replies to App
Store reviews — that is UI-only. Reading and deleting existing developer responses is
possible but low value.

Google Play's Reviews API is fully featured: list, read individual, and reply (≤350 chars).
The agent drafts the reply; the tool posts it.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `list_google_play_reviews` | List recent reviews for an app, with optional star-rating filter and pagination. |
| `reply_to_google_play_review` | Post or update a developer reply to a specific Google Play review. |

### Apple Analytics Reports

Apple's Analytics Reports API (launched March 2024, ASC API v3.4) exposes 50+ report types
as bulk downloads — downloads, crashes, subscriptions, engagement. The flow is async:
request → poll until instances available → download gzipped TSV. Three tools:

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `request_analytics_report` | Request generation of a report type for a date range. Returns a request ID. |
| `list_analytics_report_instances` | Poll for available instances of a requested report. |
| `download_analytics_report` | Download a specific report instance, decompress, and return structured data. |

### Google Play Custom Store Listings

Up to 50 custom store listings per app (100 for Play partners), each targetable by search
keyword, country, or UTM source. Same androidpublisher edit/commit pattern as existing
listing tools.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `list_google_play_custom_listings` | List all custom store listings configured for an app. |
| `get_google_play_custom_listing` | Fetch a specific custom listing by listing ID. |
| `set_google_play_custom_listing` | Create or update a custom store listing (title, short/full description, targeting). |

---

## Phase 6 — OTA updates

*Deferred until next major version. Both platforms have well-defined CLI+API paths but
the user base is segmented: Shorebird is Flutter-only, CodePush/App Center is React
Native-only. Neither is universally applicable, and both require the developer to have
already set up the OTA service. Building these well means two new subprocess-based
module pairs (shorebird.ts / tools/shorebird.ts, codepush.ts / tools/codepush.ts) and
two new env vars.*

**Note on Codemagic's OTA API endpoints:** The `/api/v3/ota/` endpoints in Codemagic's
v3 API refer to Codemagic's own React Native CodePush product, not Shorebird. Shorebird
integration would use the `shorebird` CLI with `SHOREBIRD_TOKEN` auth — it is not
surfaced through the Codemagic API.

### Shorebird (Flutter)

| Tool | Wraps | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `list_shorebird_releases` | `shorebird releases list --json` | Discover which releases have patches; find the right release version before patching |
| `create_shorebird_patch` | `shorebird patch android/ios` | Build and upload a Dart-only patch against an existing release — no store review, users get the fix in seconds |
| `rollback_shorebird_patch` | `shorebird patch rollback` | Revert a bad patch before it reaches more users |

Constraint: patches can **only** change Dart code. Any native code change (new plugin,
`build.gradle`, `Info.plist`, asset changes) requires a full store release via the
existing `ios_release` / `android_release` flow.

### CodePush (React Native)

| Tool | Wraps | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `list_codepush_deployments` | App Center API | Discover deployment keys and see current release per environment |
| `create_codepush_release` | `appcenter codepush release` | Push a JS bundle update — no store review |
| `rollback_codepush_release` | App Center API | Revert to previous bundle |

---

## Phase 7 — Hosted by Codemagic

Covered in detail in [HOSTING.md](./HOSTING.md): streamable HTTP transport,
stateless token-per-request, CLI→REST migration, credential references into the
Codemagic secret store (the moat), rollout plan. Decision pending.

### RBAC integration

Codemagic is actively developing Role Based Access Control for teams — defining what each user or token can do (trigger builds, manage variables, delete apps, etc.). The hosted MCP server should integrate with this natively:

- Tools that the token's role prohibits are hidden from the agent's tool list or return a clear authorization error before any action is taken
- `list_applications` and `list_builds` scope their results to what the token can access
- Destructive tools (`delete_webhook`, `trigger_build`) can respect approval gates if RBAC defines them

This turns Codemagic's RBAC into an **agent containment layer** — the organization decides what agents are allowed to do, not the individual developer. Critical for enterprise adoption.

The local (stdio) version benefits too: a read-only token naturally produces a server where write operations fail at the API level. RBAC makes that guarantee explicit and configurable without touching the MCP server itself.

---

## Explicitly deferred (and why)

| Capability | Verdict | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Firebase App Distribution upload | Defer to yaml | `publishing.firebase:` in codemagic.yaml is the deterministic path; we add a template. An official Firebase MCP server exists for the rest. |
| Slack / email / Telegram notifications | Defer to yaml | First-class in codemagic.yaml publishing; our templates cover it for free. |
| BrowserStack device testing | Defer | Official, actively maintained BrowserStack MCP server exists; users compose it alongside ours. |
| Maestro / E2E in cloud | Defer to yaml | Runs as script steps on Codemagic VMs already. |
| In-app purchases / subscriptions | Later | Full API + asc CLI support exists, but it is a deep domain; revisit on demand. |
| iOS App Store review replies | Not possible | ASC API has no POST for developer replies — UI-only. Reading/deleting existing replies is possible but low value. |
| Google Play review replies | Phase 5 | Moving to Phase 5 — clean REST API, high value. |
| Apple Analytics Reports | Phase 5 | Moving to Phase 5 — ASC API v3.4 (March 2024), 50+ report types. |
| OTA updates (Shorebird / CodePush) | Phase 6 | Segmented audiences (Flutter vs React Native); both need separate CLIs and credentials. Deferred until Phase 5 is stable. |
| In-app purchases / subscriptions | Later | Full API + asc CLI support exists, but it is a deep domain that shifts product identity from CI/CD to monetization manager. |
| App size monitoring | Later (external) | Emerge Tools / Sentry have APIs; only useful if the team already uses one of those services. |
| Diawi, Appetize.io | Skip / park | Superseded by TestFlight + internal app sharing; Appetize's browser-preview is interesting for demos but unverified. |

---

## Sequencing rationale

Phase 2 before Phase 3 because an agent that can *ship* but not *decorate* is
useful; the reverse is not. Phase 4 is interleaved-able — the checklist prompt
costs little and serves the exact audience we target. Phase 5 closes the "what
happened after I shipped?" loop — test results, analytics, and review engagement
are the natural next questions once the build → publish path is solid. Phase 6
(OTA) is segmented by platform and requires the developer to have already set up
an OTA service, so it does not block Phase 5 or the 1.0 launch. Phase 7
(hosted) is a Codemagic business decision, not an engineering sequence point —
nothing in Phases 2–6 blocks on it, and everything in them increases its value.
